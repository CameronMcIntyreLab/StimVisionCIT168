# StimVisionCIT168


SUPPORTED Mac OS: 
10.13 High Sierra
10.14 Mojave
10.15 Catalina


INSTALLATION:
Download and mount the dmg.  Drag the StimVisionCIT168 icon into the Applications folder.

RUNNING THE SOFTWARE:
If you get a message saying it was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer go to Settings -> Security & Privacy -> and choose "Open Anyway"

Every time the software is opened, the user must accept the terms in the disclaimer window at which point the user interface panels will become available.

It is best to use a large monitor, because small laptop screens may make it difficult to access the entire main UI panel.

It should take anwywhere from four to ten minutes to perform the driving force calculations for a given set of stimulation parameters.

KNOWN ISSUES:
The user may see warning messages about degenerate triangles in the mesh while performing the driving force calculations. Any affected streamlines are removed from the driving force calculations.
